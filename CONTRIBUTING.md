## How much time do you have?
### Less 10 minutes
 - Talk to a friend about online misogyny and what Opt Out Tools are trying to achieve
 - Post online about the issue
 - Talk to us on slack about bright ideas you have for new/better functionality
 
### Less 30 minutes
 - Look through the open issues for a problem that is small and sweet to fix
 - Post/tell lots of people about the issue!

### Programming (1+ hours)

Take a look through the open issues and then check with pull requests to make sure that someone isn't already working on it. Please post in an issue to say that you're working on it.

If you are making a substantial or potentially controversial change, your first port of call should be to stop by and chat to us on Slack or file an issue to discuss what you would like to change. We really don't want you to waste time on a pull request (GitHub jargon for a contribution) that has no chance of being merged.

If you have no tests, your code won't be merged. We're aiming for 100% test coverage.

## The Organisation, Repos and Projects
Opt Out Tools is the name of the overall organisation. We have different projects that are for specific pieces of work (see the project [Antidote to Silicon Valley KPIs](https://github.com/orgs/opt-out-tools/projects/28) for an example). A project can span multiple repositories.  All projects are a part of Opt Out Tools.

### Project management
Each issue in the repos take one of three forms, a either a bug, a feature request or feature implementation (task). 

- Bug: a problem with the code that needs fixing
- Feature request: an idea for new features
- Feature implementation (task): concrete steps to be completed to add the feature

Each issue should be labeled with a minimum of two labels, one to indicate priority and the second to indicate size of task. It should also belong to a milestone. We have four milestones over the next months, which look like this:

Milestone (version) name and description:

- 0.1: the minimum viable product (MVP), what is the minimum functionality our product/s can have to be ready
- 0.2: what is then expected by the end user for the product/s to have
- 0.3: what features would be good to have in the product/s
- 0.4 (Future): the future of our product/s

Concrete details of what each milestone contains can be found in the roadmaps, titled by the name of the tool. To find out what tools we have, please see [Our Tools and Our Vision](https://github.com/opt-out-tools/start-here#Our-Tools-and-Our-Vision) 
For example, to find out at a high-level what we want to achieve in terms of Activism by the 0.1 milestone, see the [Activism Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/opt-out-tools/projects/37)

An overview can be found of all can be found here [start-here](https://github.com/opt-out-tools/start-here)

Each issue should also belong to a project. You can find a short description of the project in the project tile.
